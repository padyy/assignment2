# Manual
This package is about a django project called Assignment 2 Brief. It includes crud functionality for a model named Trainer.
You can access the pages by running the server. To do so, find the path (...\Assignment2_Brief\myenv\CRUD) right after you activate the V.E.
Then run "python manage.py runserver". Finally, copy this link to your browser ( personal preference firefox for avoiding browser's bugs):
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/trainer/Home/
After that, you can enjoy the other pages by using the navbar at the top of each page.
